abstract: In this paper, we modify and apply the recently introduced Mixed Newton Method, which is originally designed for minimizing real-valued functions of complex variables, to the minimization of real-valued functions of real variables by extending the functions to complex space. We show that arbitrary regularizations preserve the favorable local convergence properties of the method, and construct a special type of regularization used to prevent convergence to complex minima. We compare several variants of the method applied to training neural networks with real and complex parameters.
